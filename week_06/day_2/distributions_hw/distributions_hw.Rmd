```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(prob)
library(janitor)
```
1.1 Load the data, clean_names() and explore it.

```{r}
mobile <- read_csv("data/20190928-items.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()
mobile
```

1.2 Find the brand with the highest numbers of phones in the dataset.

```{r}
mobile %>% 
  count(brand) %>% 
  slice_max(n)
```

1.3 For your top brand, plot the distribution of phone ratings as a probability density, overlaying a fitted normal distribution. Do you think the normal distribution provides a good model of these ratings?
